Your microservices or mobile applications are typically secured using authentication tokens like JWT. Often, short-lived access tokens are used so that even if they are stolen, the window for misuse is small. In other cases, refresh tokens are securely stored on the device, and used to request a new access token when needed. However, relying solely on token-based authentication is not enough for high-risk domains like banking or healthcare.

Security in customer-facing applications must be implemented in a way that does not significantly compromise user experience. Customers want a smooth and frictionless interaction. security should be seamless and feel like a natural part of the product, not a burden. FinTech and other sensitive sectors must go beyond simple authentication mechanisms. Service-level or app-level authentication alone is insufficient. Product owners need to adopt multiple layers of security and balance them carefully with usability.

Users should have flexible authentication options. However, avoid enforcing all available security methods on every user. For example:

1. Some users prefer OTPs via email or SMS.
2. Others might prefer authentication apps like Google Authenticator or biometric logins.

Apply different methods based on user preference, risk level, or transaction sensitivity.

If a customer's credentials are compromised, token-based authentication will not prevent unauthorized access unless additional mechanisms are in place, such as:

1. Device fingerprinting: Detects and remembers known devices.
2. Geo-fencing: Restricts login from unusual or distant locations.
3. Behavioral analytics: Alerts or blocks logins from suspicious locations or patterns.
4. Instant user notification: Notifies the user when a new device or location is detected.

However, not all systems have this level of intelligence built-in. Therefore, multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a must-have, particularly for sensitive data. MFA can involve:

1. OTPs (One-Time Passwords) via phone or email.
2. Time-based codes from authentication apps.
3. Biometric verification on supported devices.

If your app does not handle high-risk operations like payments or medical data, consider allowing multiple sign-in options (social login, email link login, etc.) to improve onboarding and usability.

When using refresh tokens, be cautious. If the refresh token is long-lived, rotate it after each use to reduce the risk of replay attacks. This means issuing a new refresh token on each refresh request and invalidating the old one.

Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) everywhere. This is not optional. Do not deploy any service to production unless end-to-end encryption is enabled. Additionally:
Secure backend services so they are only accessible by trusted frontend apps (e.g., mobile or web clients).

1. Use reverse proxies, API gateways, or network firewalls to restrict access to internal services.
2. Re-authentication should be required before high-risk actions such as:
Large or unusual financial transactions.
3. Changes to security-sensitive preferences (e.g., password, phone number).
4. Accessing or exporting personal data.
5. Fraud detection and prevention must also be prioritized:
6. Rate limiting: Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting failed login attempts (e.g., lock or block after 5 failed tries).
7. Bot protection: Use CAPTCHA or other tools to detect and block automated abuse.
8. Audit logging and anomaly detection: Log all authentication and sensitive events for auditing. Do not store sensitive data in logs, but capture enough detail to detect suspicious behavior and investigate issues.

Security is not just about protecting systems. it's about protecting users in a way that doesn't frustrate them. The best systems are both secure and user-friendly.
